Puts returns the evaluated code and prints to the console.
An interger is a whole number, a float is a number that includes the number behind the decimal place.
Float division actually divides the numbers (so 5/2 = 2.5), where innteger division is closer ot asking if I have 5 dollars, and I want to buy something that's two dollars, how many can I get, so the answer is 2.

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

- Ruby handles those operations well (I'm not 100% sure if I understand the question). But all the operations are built in, and follow normal order of operations.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

- Strings are non-number, non boolean values.  And they can be used any way you would normally type. They are especially useful for variables.


What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are variables that only have meaning within the function in which they've been assigned. They are crucial to creating useful repetative code.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

Super easy, no problem. Definitely helped me remember the basics.
