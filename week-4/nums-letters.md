- What is an integer? What is float?

An integer is any number without a decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

-Integer division will always round down to the nearest ineteger.  Float division will round to the number of decimal places included in the question.
