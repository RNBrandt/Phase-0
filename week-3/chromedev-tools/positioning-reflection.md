-How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Since the feedback for each change is immediate, you know if the change you plan on making will actually do what you want it to without affecting the source code or having to switch windows and refreshing the page.


-How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

I'm not sure if I understand this question. You click on the element or the apropriate margin, padding, or border number and change the size to reflect teh size that you want.


-What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute uses the top bottom and sides of the page as the base against which you position your element.  This is very useful because it allows you to position your element exactly where you want it to go.

Fixed means the element will stay exactly where it is on the screen regardless of how the rest of the page moves (eg it will stay visible if the user scrolls down the page).

Static is the the default for each element, it doesn't mean much other than it's the default and elements can be reset to static to undo lousy formatting.

Relative positioning is closer to meaning 'relative to itself'  in and of itself this formatting doesn't change the location of the element, but if you create another position attribute it will shift the element from its default location (not from any one side or element).


-What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

The margin is space completely outside the element and is used primarily for positioning with regard to other elements or the side of the page.

The border is the outer edge of the element, and can be made to be whatever size it needs to be.

The padding is similar to the margin, but is part of the element and represents the space between the content and the border.


What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I really didn't like this challenge.  As a practice I think the exercises were good, but there were no instructions with this challenge and that was exceptionally frustrating.
