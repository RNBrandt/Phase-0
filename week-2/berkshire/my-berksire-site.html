<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was great. It's very rewarding to see work become manifest on the internet.  It really feels like I'm creating something.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Remarakably easy.  In researching Git and command line issues, I often felt like there was a bunch of jargon that I didn't know and may end up messing up and important configuration without ever knowing it.  With HTML there is much less jargon, and there seems to be a clearer cause and effect.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
That was pretty easy; I don't know how to do it, so when a formatting problem came up, I simply didn't look it up.  It really called to my lazy side!

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It's very simple and there are clear causes and effects. However, because it's so easy, it has limited functionality on its own.


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Close the tag before you input the content.  I don't have any others at the moment yet, since I'm still so new, but I'm excited to read what other people have found useful!<
