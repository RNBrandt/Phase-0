# Reflections 2.3

##1.  What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

1) Information Gathering.  This is where you learn what the requirements will be for the website.
2) Planning. Create an outline based on what you learned in step 1
3) Design.  A non-technical image based minimum viable product. This is essentially a series of still images that show what the website will look like.
4) Development.  This is where the rubber meets the road, and a functional website is created.
5) Testing and Delivery.  Tests to make sure the site functions in every way it’s meant to and in every environment.  Then delivery to the client.
6) Maintenance. Maintaining and adding to the website.

##2.  What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

This site’s primary goal is to create a one stop-shop for my internet presence.  It will include my social media, past projects, current projects, blog, etc…

##3.  What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience is anyone who wants to give me my dream job, so this will be professional and well designed website.

##4.  What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I would like the user to consume the information available on the website, and ultimately contact me with a job offer.  I imagine this will require several different actions, so I would like it to have different actions for different people or people with different purposes.

##5.  What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

It’s most important that it be built with the USER in mind rather than the owner or engineer.  Think about what experience you want the user to have, and what story you want the website to guide them through.

##6.  What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience is exactly how it sounds. It is the experience that the user has on the website.  It’s valuable, because it is, essentially, everything.  You could be the worlds most stupendous person with tons over valuable information available, but if the user experience is so lousy that no one can, or wants to, see it then it’s all for naught.

##7.  Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I’m still struggling a bit with adding the Site-Map as an image.


I also keep running into a fatal origin error... I've been working on this for a while, and am maybe sorting it through, but the main reason I'm typing this right now is to have a change to push through the workflow.
