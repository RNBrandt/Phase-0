# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

(note: this is not ready for review)

I have taken several courses regarding time management and methods to increase productivity, so this was primarily a review.  It did, however, help reinforce several methods that I had let slip.   The power of habit, establishing good habits and allowing myself to let the habit begin to help me define myself, was of particular use.  Additionally, ‘Time Boxing” (the practice of setting a very specific amount of time aside to focus on accomplishing a specific task) has proven its worth in my life again and again.  Time in an office, or at work can certainly be considered a form of time boxing (assuming one works the way one’s boss wants), but without that structure in Phase 0 imposing structure on my work schedule (ie time boxing) will be crucial to my success.

I don’t have a day job at the moment, so managing my time currently, is more a practice of finding ways to spend all my free time rather than ways to cram activities into a busy schedule.  This allows me to read, ride my bike, and still comfortably spend as much time as needed on Phase 0.  Now, this doesn’t lend itself to a particularly efficient use of time, but for the time being, I have time to spare.  At the moment my strategy is working, but as my time becomes more precious I plan to employ the time management techniques.  Although, now that I reflect on it, now is the perfect time to establish proper habits. So, my overall plan for Phase 0 time management is to use the growth mindset to help me attempt different practices and eventually establish great time management habits (such as using the Pomodoro technique, to help me focus within my ‘time boxes’)  in preparation for the later part of Phase 0 and the initiation of Phase 1 and beyond.

# The Command Line

(note this is not ready for review)

*A Shell is any piece of software that allows the user to interface with the operating system.  OSX is the graphical user interface (GUI) shell software for my Mac computer.  Like OSX Bash is a type of shell program, however, it’s text and command based rather than graphical.

*I’m very used to GUIs so it was difficult for me to contextualize what I was doing in Bash.  It really helped to have the GUI open so I can watch the changes happen and create a system of command synonyms for myself.

*I was able to do everything in the exercises, but I’m still not 100% sure what some of the commands actually do.  Particularly the pipes (<,>, |) I’m going to give myself a break with these commands and give it another go in a day or two.
*For the moment pwd, ls, and cd are the most important.  With those two I can find where I am know what the files and documents in the directory are, and move between them.  I’m sure that will change as I become more adept at utilizing this functionality, but for the moment these are the most useful to me.

*Pwd, print working directory it displays where you are in the computers directory.

*ls, (I remember it as list) and it displays the contents of the working directory

*mv, I didn’t remember off the top of my head, but reviewing the content tells me that it’s move or rename files.  I had trouble using this one, and I’ll have to review it in a day or so.

*Cd, change directory- does exactly what it’s an abrieviation for.

*../ goes with cd, it changes the directory to the file above it in the tree.
